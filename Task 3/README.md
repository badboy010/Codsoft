#TASK
CALCULATOR

To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize
CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and
loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
